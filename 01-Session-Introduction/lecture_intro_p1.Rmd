<!--
Let's start to study applied biostatistics.
-->

## Applied Biostatistics I

Introduction


<!--
In this session, I will go through all the overall features of this course, and
then talk about some general issues of multivariate statistical analysis.
-->

## Outline

Course Orientation
Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis

<!--
In this course, we study multiple linear regression and logistic regression,
and some related issues. The overall schedule is, we study multiple linear
regression in the first half of this course, and logistic regression in the
second half.
-->

## Major Topics

1. Course Orientation

Multiple linear regression

Logistic regression

<!--
As a course in statistics, this course is application oriented. We will focus
on how to use the statistical methods that we learn, and how to interpret
results of the statistical analysis, rather than mathematical theories
underlying those methods. We will also place emphasis on how to use computers
effectively when we carry out those statistical analyses.
-->

## Course characteristics

* Application-oriented
* Computer-oriented
* Will analyze widely used publicly-available health data (NHANES, BRFSS, HMD…)
* Will not put strong emphasis on mathematical theories (proofs, derivations)


<!--
You are supposed to have taken a course in introductory statistics or
biostatistics, and have general understanding of these basic statistical
concepts and tools. But you don't have to be able to remember their formulas
exactly. No background in advanced mathematics, such as calculus and matrix
algebra or linear algebra, is required. Basics of the exponential function and
logistic function that you studied in your high school algebra course, will be
used in the second half of this course.
-->

## Required Statistical Background

* Standard deviation, variance
* Normal distribution, t-distribution
* Statistical significance, p-value, null hypothesis,
* one-sided and two-sided tests
* Confidence interval, standard error, sampling distribution
* Pearson’s correlation coefficient, simple linear regression
* No calculus or matrix algebra required
* The exponential and logistic function in the second half (very basic treatment)


<!--
These days, computers are used heavily in statistical analysis. Computer
software used in statistical analysis may be classified into these four groups.
User-friendly statistical software packages such as SPSS, sass and Stata are
widely used. More technically oriented users may prefer to use programming
oriented statistical software or computational software such as R, Matlab, and
Gauss. Originally, statisticians did statistical analyses using programming
languages such as Fortran. In addition, these days, spreadsheets are equipped
with more statistical functions, so quite a few statistical analyses can be
done using a spreadsheet such as Excel, which also produces good graphics. In
this course, we will use sass, which is widely used in public health research.
We will also use Excel, which can effectively complement sass.
-->

## Widely Used Software for Statistical Analysis

* User-friendly statistical software (SPSS, SAS, STATA, …)
* Programming-oriented statistical/computational software (MATLAB, R, Gauss, …)
* Programming languages (C++, Pascal, Basic, APL, Fortran, …)
* Spreadsheets including Excel

<!--
Full licensed sass is available on all public computer workstations at SPH,
such as those in classrooms and student rounges. There are several options for
running sass at home. First, the school has sass available for student use, and
you can install it on your PC, which is strongly recommended.  Second, you can
purchase a full license of sass for your PC. But, for most of you, it is
probably unnecessary to buy one, because now you can install sass, or have it
installed, on your PC, free of charge.  Third, CUNY has sass in virtual
desktop, to which you have remote access through your computer, so you can run
sass from home.  Lastly, sass has free online services such as sass University
edition and sass on demand, through which you can have free remote access to
sass. But sass available through these services may be slightly different from
the full licensed sass. Sass University edition and sass on demand are not
supported in this course. That is, we do not provide help in running sass
through these remote access services.
-->

## SAS access

Options for running SAS at home:

* Install SPH-licensed SAS
* Purchase a full license of SAS (A full-licensed SAS is used at SPH)
* Use CUNY Virtual Desktop
* Other means of free remote access to SAS
    * SAS University Edition (SAS Studio)

<!--
There are two ways to use sass. First, you start sass, open sass menus, make
choices from the menus and interactive windows, and execute them. Second, you
write sass programs by yourself, and submit them to sass for execution.
Emphasis of this course is placed on writing sass programs, because having SAS
skills and experiences usually means being able to write sass programs.
-->

## SAS operation

1) Point-and-Click
2) Write SAS programs (codes, scripts)

Emphasis of this course is on 2.
